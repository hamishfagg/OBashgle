OBashgle - A bash interface used from Omegle.

Allow users of Omegle.com to control your PC - provided they know how to use bash!
OBashgle connects to a stranger on Omegle.com, and runs anything they say as a command - replying with the output of said command.
Keeps track of current directories so that users can use cd.

I would STRONGLY advise against using this on a physical machine, if at all (unless you like re-installing operating systems).
To be fair the bash-knowers I've found on Omegle so far have been interested more than destructive (I left them a puzzle to get root access to a VM), but still.

To run:

<code>
python obashgle.py
</code>

Watch and wait.. There is nothing that you can do other than watch at this stage.

The script currently has some limitations, the main one being that it runs a command from python with popen, and waits for it to return.
Thus, it can't run anything that does not return by itself (well it can, but the script hangs indefinitely).

I'll try to implement something to get around this soon.


Just a note:

I HAVE looked for terms of service or rules on Omegle.com, and have found nothing.
Based on this, I can only assume that Omegle has no rules agains this sort of thing.
If you find info to suggest otherwise, please let me know (and I'll add "Don't actually use this" to the bottom of this readme).


I do NOT take responsibility for ANY damage to your stuff if you hand over the controls to a stranger on Omegle. Sorry.
